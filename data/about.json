He favours the data science aspect of AI and ML rather than games, and has been working with data since grade 11. He joined UAIS in its very first year and has since been working hard on explaining that AI probably will not take over the world, and he writes the newsletters for the club. He competes in olympic weightlifting, mountain bike races, and is generally a cool guy. He also tutors two math courses, and so along with Justin he is a great resource for any math or stats troubles you may have.",

He has been interested in Computer Vision in the past and maybe still interested but his focus may change as he gets more experience with AI. He is surprisingly not a gamer and slightly naive when it comes to the AI world, making him a good go to for anyone who is interested in learning about AI from the ground up.",
