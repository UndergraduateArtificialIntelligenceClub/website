    "description": "Paul Saunders is a second year student in a Computing Science Specialization degree. He favours the data science aspect of AI and ML rather than games, and has been working with data since grade 11. He joined UAIS in its very first year and has since been working hard on explaining that AI probably will not take over the world, and he writes the newsletters for the club. He competes in olympic weightlifting, mountain bike races, and is generally a cool guy. He also tutors two math courses, and so along with Justin he is a great resource for any math or stats troubles you may have.",
