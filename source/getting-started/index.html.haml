    Get Started

    Here are some usefull ressources to get started in Machine Learning
  :markdown
    + First, [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads). Before doing so, you can check to see if you already have Python installed by opening a Terminal (Mac or Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and typing `python` or `python3`. If a shell opens, note the version number. For Tensorflow to work effectively, we recommend using **Python 3.6.7**.
    + Once you have Python installed, pip should be installed by default. Try the following commands to install OpenAI Gym: `pip install gym`. If this doesn’t work, try the variants: `python -m pip install gym` or `py -m pip install gym` or `pip3 install gym`. **This will be dependent upon what command you type in the shell to make Python run.**
    + Once you have Gym installed, begin working through the [Documentation tutorial](https://gym.openai.com/docs). To get the code running, we recommend either using [Wing101 Ide](https://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/). 
    + For two more non-standard IDE’s, consider using [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/). For the latter, type `pip install jupyter` [*see variants above*]. 
    + If you want some fun challenging exercises in Python to start playing around, consider
        + [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
        + [Learn Python Tutorials](https://www.learnpython.org/)
        + [Challenging exercise](https://www.codewars.com/collections/basic-python)
    + After this, we began working through this series of [OpenAI Gym tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/openai-cartpole-neural-network-example-machine-learning-tutorial/). We went through the first two steps of making the initial population.
    + To apply neural networks, we have to then use Tensorflow. For the basics of Tensorflow:

            + [Deep Q Learning](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/reinforcement-learning-tensorflow/).

    **General Machine Learning**:
    <br>
    [Machine Learning with Andrew Ng, Stanford University](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLssT5z_DsK-h9vYZkQkYNWcItqhlRJLN)
    <br>
    Universally recommended machine learning lectures by Andrew Ng, for beginner and intermediate level machine learning.

    **Reinforcement Learning**:
    <br>
    [Reinforcement Learning with David Silver](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDM-OYHWgPebj2MfCFzFObQ)
    <br>
    Older but popular lecture series by lead DeepMind researcher David Silver at King’s College London.  Follows along with the first edition of Introduction to RL by Sutton and Barto.

    **Various**:
    <br>
    [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School 2018](http://videolectures.net/DLRLsummerschool2018_toronto/)
    <br>
    These are the lecture videos from the 2018 DLRL summer school, held by CIFAR, Amii, and the Vector Institute in Toronto.  The DLRL summer school is pretty competitive, but the lectures actually vary from introductory to advanced.  Links to the slides are also included on the video pages.

    [Advanced Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning with DeepMind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZDNJre23vqCGIVpfZ_K2RZs)
    <br>
    A brand new lecture series (2018) done at UCL by a bunch of DeepMind staff.
