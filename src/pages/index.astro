		<h3 class="title">NHL Positivity Index Project</h3>
		<p>Inspired by youtuber, Shannon Skanes AKA 'The Hockey Guy' and his intriguing 'NHL Panic Index' video series, 
		the Undergraduate Artificial Intelligence Society is working on the NHL Positivity Index Project. 
		Our mission is to explore the depths of NHL fandom by harnessing the emerging capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
		By continuously gathering a vast array of sentiments from NHL team's subreddits, 
		we are striving to develop a methodology to quantify the positivity tied to each NHL team in a given time period. 
		As this project unfolds, we hope to capture the dynamic emotions coursing through the hockey season, offering a novel, 
		data-driven lens onto the passionate dialogues of fans.</p>

		<h3 class="title">Discord Bot Project</h3>
		<p> In this project, we’ll learn how to build a bot for Discord using the discord.py Python library. 
		The bot will initially be able to handle requests and automate various tasks such as keeping track of members and 
		assigning roles, taking suggestions/feedback from club members, and other features that the team comes up with during 
		brainstorming sessions. We’ll then further enhance these features and add more functionality such as suggesting learning 
		resources and opportunities to people based on their level of expertise by integrating AI functionality into the bot, using 
		tools such as GPT.</p>
