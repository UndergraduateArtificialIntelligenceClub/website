		<h3 class="title">NHL Panic Index Project</h3>
		<p></p> Inspired by youtuber, Shannon Skanes AKA 'The Hockey Guy' and his intriguing 'NHL Panic Index' video series, 
		the Undergraduate Artificial Intelligence Society is working on the NHL Panic Index Project. 
		Our mission is to explore the depths of NHL fandom by harnessing the emerging capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

		By continuously gathering a vast array of sentiments from platforms like Reddit and Twitter, 
		we are striving to develop a methodology to quantify the prevailing 'panic' or concern tied to each NHL team. 
		As this project unfolds, we hope to capture the dynamic emotions coursing through the hockey season, offering a novel, 
		data-driven lens onto the passionate dialogues of fans.

		If you would like to join the team message Jacob Winch on discord

		We meet every Friday in the Student Innovation Center in CCIS from 5:00pm - 6:00pm!
