		<h2 class="title is-1">Rocket League</h2>
		<p>
			We are starting a project to build our own machine learning rocket
			league bot using the same framework of Nexto!
		</p>
		<p>
			For those who haven't heard of it, Rocket League is basically soccer
			with cars if all the cars had rockets attached to their rear bumpers.
			It allows for some incredibly complex gameplay that lends itself
			perfectly to a machine learning scenario.
		</p>
		<p>
			Due to our limited time & computing resources, we likely won't be
			able to build a bot on the level of Nexto as its trained for 250k
			hours. Instead, we will likely take a supervised learning approach
			using data from <a href="http://ballchasing.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ballchasing.com</a>.
			Of course, if everyone working on it wants to use RL then we can
			absolutely do that!
