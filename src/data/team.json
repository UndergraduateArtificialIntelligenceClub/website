Iâ€™ve done machine learning research twice at the University of Alberta and gained industry experience thatâ€™s helped me explore AI from both academic and real-world perspectives. After serving as VP Internal of UAIS, Iâ€™m now excited to lead as President and help grow a club where students can explore, build, and feel supported. In my free time, I code, run a platform called AthenaCodes.org, and read books. Always happy to chat!",
