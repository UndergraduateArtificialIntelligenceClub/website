When he's not geeking out about technology and working on projects and internships, such as the Discord bot project he just wrapped up as part of the UAIS, and writing very bug-riddled code, he's probably trying to advocate for accessibility, particularly for high-level STEM subjects, on his personal website [https://inclusionmotto.com]. You'll probably find him listening to a new audiobook, weird, trippy, out-of-this-world music, or practicing mindfulness when it's time to relax and wind down.",
