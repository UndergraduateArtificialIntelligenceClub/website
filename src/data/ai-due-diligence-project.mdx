# AI Due Diligence Project (UAIS x UAFund)

## The Partnership
UAIS has partnered with the **University of Alberta Innovation Fund (UA Fund)** to support their AI Due Diligence process, which evaluates startups applying for investment. The UA Fund’s AI Due Diligence Committee applies a specialized checklist to identify companies that meaningfully integrate AI, rather than using it superficially. 

Through this collaboration, UAIS will conduct early-stage AI assessments on 1–2 startups per quarter before they reach the fund’s formal investment committee.

## What You'll Gain
Members will gain hands-on experience analyzing real companies, learning to assess technical and business viability, and developing clear evaluation metrics understandable to non-technical investors. This partnership offers UAIS members unique access to the UA Fund’s network of investors, entrepreneurs, and AI experts, as well as opportunities for research, mentorship, and professional growth.

## Expectations & Commitment
The work will be carried out through bi-weekly meetings, collaborative brainstorming, market research, and report writing. As this project involves working with an external partner, members are expected to demonstrate a high level of commitment, reliability, and follow-through to ensure the success of our collaboration and maintain UAIS’s professional reputation.

All participants are required to follow strict confidentiality protocols to protect sensitive information. By contributing to this process, UAIS not only strengthens its industry connections but also builds a track record in applied AI evaluation, positioning members for future success in AI, research, and venture capital.
