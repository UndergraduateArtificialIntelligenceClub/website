+ First, [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads). Before doing so, you can check to see if you already have Python installed by opening a Terminal (Mac or Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and typing `python` or `python3`. If a shell opens, note the version number. We recommend using **at least Python 3.11**.
+ For an IDE we recommend either using [Wing101 Ide](https://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
+ For two more non-standard IDEâ€™s, consider using [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), or [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). For the latter, type `pip install jupyter` [*see variants above*].
