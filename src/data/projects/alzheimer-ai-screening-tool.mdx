# Speech-Based Alzheimer AI Screening Tool
- **Difficulty:** Advanced (healthcare and NLP)
- **Term Length:** Fall 2025 (with possibility of extension to full year)

## Description
This project aims to develop a web or mobile app that allows users to record short speech samples. The backend will process the speech with a fine-tuned BERT-family model to estimate Alzheimer’s prediction scores - this is not a diagnosis. The fine-tuned BERT model is based on the project lead’s published research. The tool emphasizes accessibility, affordability, and ethical AI usage.

## Skills Gained
- Experience with HuggingFace, PyTorch, and BERT models
- Backend development with Flask or FastAPI
- Web or mobile frontend using React or Streamlit

## Technical Details
- **ML & Backend:** Python
