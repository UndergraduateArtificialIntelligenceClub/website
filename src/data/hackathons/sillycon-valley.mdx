# The Goal: Build Something Weird
The UAIS SillyCon Valley Hackathon is a two-day event where the goal is simple: **build the silliest, most creative thing you can with AI.**

This is not a startup grind. It is not about polished demos or perfect code. It is about experimenting, joking around, learning by doing, and seeing what happens when you give yourself permission to build something weird. Whether that means a useless AI, a cursed idea, or a surprisingly clever project that started as a joke, it all belongs here.

## How It Works
- **Teams:** Work in teams of three.
- **The Challenge:** Build something using or implementing AI in any form.
- **Experience:** None required! If you are new to hackathons or AI, this is a great place to start. If you are experienced, this is a chance to loosen up.

## Logistics
There will be food, prizes, and fun! Registration is done per team to help cover food and event costs.

If you have ever wanted to try a hackathon but felt intimidated, **SillyCon Valley Hackathon is designed for you.**
