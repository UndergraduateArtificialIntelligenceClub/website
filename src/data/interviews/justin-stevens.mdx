### While the headlines right now are focused on extreme AI topics, is there a specific trend in AI safety that you feel most people should be paying attention to?

> Justin Stevens: AI safety is definitely a very important area. The angle that I care about a lot is how people are being educated about AI. This is especially important in the era of deepfakes. I did an exercise where we tried to detect if images were real or not, and as a group, we only got about 60% correct. Being educated about AI is going to be one of the most important things going forward so people don't get manipulated. I am not so big on the existential risk of AI yet; I'm thinking more about ensuring people do not get manipulated by AI systems.

### Do you see any laws being passed by governments in the future to try and hinder or limit malicious uses like deepfakes?

> Justin Stevens: Yeah, definitely. The European Union probably has the most restrictive AI laws right now with the AI Act. I know the Canadian and U.S. governments have thought about that too. I think it's good that governments are beginning to take this seriously.

### Are there tools in AI that are being pushed in research as the next revolutionary thing, but their practicality is lacking? Or vice versa?

> Justin Stevens: I think there are definitely tools on the industry side that people in academia are not as privy to. A lot of research is being done behind closed doors at big companies to protect competitive edges. Conversely, trends in research, like user studies on how people interact with AI, aren't being adopted enough in industry. Companies often release products without researching how they impact users—ChatGPT was released without much research into safety and fairness beyond the goal of profit.

### If we keep allowing these AI companies to black-box their research, how can we combat this if there's no legal penalty?

> Justin Stevens: It ultimately has to do with public perception and whether people are willing to boycott products they view as unethical. With Meta, for example, I uninstalled Facebook after seeing how they value profits over ethics. If the goal is just profits, companies will continue to do unethical things. But if the goal is releasing AI safely, they will gain trust, which is better in the long run.

### For someone looking to get into AI, seeing big money floating around, should they focus on being a mathematician first or a computer scientist first?

> Justin Stevens: I was a mathematician first. I think mathematics underpins everything else in the field. I recommend anyone wanting to get into AI take linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics. That said, the barrier to entry is lower today. You can use pre-built tools in PyTorch or TensorFlow without doing deep math every day.

### What would you say is the bedrock between foundations, projects, and communication?

> Justin Stevens: My personal opinion is that technical skills can be learned on the job. I feel like communication skills and being a good person to work with are some of the most important things. If I were in a hiring position, I would look for the soft skills a lot.

### Do you have any heuristics for a new graduate to find a community where they feel accepted while also earning a decent salary?

> Justin Stevens: There was a talk that emphasized three pillars of a good career: **fun, learning, and money**. You want a job that pays enough, but also one where you learn and have fun. Look for companies where you are mission-aligned. I'd argue that is more important than getting the highest-paying job immediately, because you want to set yourself up for a long career without burning out.

### You're the founder of the Undergraduate AI Society. What was an unexpected lesson you learned from starting this community?

> Justin Stevens: UAIS has had a really big impact on my life. It was a great lesson in leadership and networking. Founding UAIS connected me with professors and the community, which led to my Master's degree and current career. Logistically, the hardest part was getting the paperwork approved! But finding an executive group that was tied to the mission was crucial. It makes me so happy to see the club still going strong.
