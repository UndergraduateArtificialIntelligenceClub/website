+ First, [Download python](https://www.python.org/downloads). Before doing so, you can check to see if you already have Python installed by opening a Terminal (Mac or Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and typing `python` or `python3`. If a shell opens, note the version number. For Tensorflow to work effectively, we recommend using **at least Python 3.6.7**.
+ Once you have Python installed, pip should be installed by default. Try the following commands to install OpenAI Gym: `pip install gym`. If this doesn’t work, try the variants: `python -m pip install gym` or `py -m pip install gym` or `pip3 install gym`. **This will be dependent upon what command you type in the shell to make Python run.**
+ Once you have Gym installed, begin working through the [Documentation tutorial](https://gym.openai.com/docs). To get the code running, we recommend either using [Wing101 Ide](https://wingware.com/downloads/wingide-101), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
+ For two more non-standard IDE’s, consider using [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), or [Vim](https://www.vim.org/). For the latter, type `pip install jupyter` [*see variants above*].

+ After this, we began working through this series of [OpenAI Gym tutorials](https://pythonprogramming.net/openai-cartpole-neural-network-example-machine-learning-tutorial/). We went through the first two steps of making the initial population.
+ To apply neural networks, we have to then use Tensorflow. For the basics of Tensorflow:
