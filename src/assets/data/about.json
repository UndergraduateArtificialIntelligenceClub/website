He favours the data science aspect of AI and ML rather than games, and has been working with data since grade 11. He joined UAIS in its very first year and has since been working hard on explaining that AI probably will not take over the world, and he writes the newsletters for the club. He competes in olympic weightlifting, mountain bike races, and is generally a cool guy. He also tutors two math courses, and so along with Justin he is a great resource for any math or stats troubles you may have.",

When it comes to AI he’s mainly interested in AI in gaming, but he is also interested in AI in therapy. Dylan is a beginner to AI who’s using it to beat and break games, so he’s a great resource if you’re also learning about AI from the ground up. In his spare time, he’s a skateboarder, photographer, filmmaker, gamer, and long-distance runner, so overall he’s a pretty cool guy.",
