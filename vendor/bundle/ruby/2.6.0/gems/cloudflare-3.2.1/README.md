# Cloudflare

It is a Ruby wrapper for the Cloudflare V4 API. It provides a light weight wrapper using `RestClient::Resource`. The wrapper functionality is limited to zones and DNS records at this time, *PRs welcome*.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ioquatix/cloudflare.svg)](http://travis-ci.org/ioquatix/cloudflare)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cloudflare'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install cloudflare
```

## Usage

Prepare a connection to the remote API:

```ruby
require 'cloudflare'

# Grab some details from somewhere:
email = ENV['CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL']
key = ENV['CLOUDFLARE_KEY']

# Set up the connection:
connection = Cloudflare.connect(key: key, email: email)
```

Get all available zones:

```ruby
zones = connection.zones.all
```

Get a specific zone:

```ruby
zone = connection.zones.find_by_id("...")
zone = connection.zones.find_by_name("example.com")
```

Get DNS records for a given zone:

```ruby
dns_records = zones.first.dns_records.all
```

Show some details of the DNS record:

```ruby
dns_record = records.first
puts records.first.record[:name]
puts records
```

Get firewall rules:

```ruby
all_rules =  zones.first.firewall_rules.all
block_rules = zones.first.firewall_rules.all("block")  # or "whitelist" or "challenge"
```

Get blocked ips:

```ruby
block_rules = zones.first.firewall_rules.all("block") 
blocked_ips = zones.first.firewall_rules.firewalled_ips(block_rules)
```

Block an ip:

```ruby
# ip = "nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn"
# note: "some note about the block"
data = {"mode":"block","configuration":{"target":"ip","value":"#{ip}"},"notes":"#{note} #{Time.now.strftime("%m/%d/%y")} "}
response = zones.first.firewall_rules.post(data.to_json, content_type: 'application/json')
```

Add a DNS record dynamically.  Here we add an A record for `batman.example.com`:

```ruby
client = Cloudflare.connect(key: CF_KEY, email: CF_EMAIL)
zone = client.zones.find_by_name("example.com")
zone.dns_records.post({"type":"A","name":"batman","content":"127.0.0.1","proxied":false}.to_json, :content_type => "application/json")
```
